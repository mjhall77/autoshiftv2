# Vault (production)

Deploys HashiCorp Vault from the upstream Helm chart, wrapped by PolicyGenerator, as a **production**
HA cluster:

- **HA**: raft integrated storage, 3 nodes, PodDisruptionBudget, `retry_join` auto-join
- **Persistence**: a `data` PVC per node (`autoshift.io/vault-storage-size`, `-storage-class`)
- **TLS**: serving cert from cert-manager (`vault-tls`), listener + raft peers use HTTPS
- **Injector**: the agent-injector sidecar is enabled for secret injection into workloads
- **Resources**: requests/limits on server + injector

## Requirements
- `autoshift.io/vault: 'true'` on the clusterset/cluster.
- **cert-manager** operator + a **ClusterIssuer** (default `autoshift-ca`; override with
  `autoshift.io/vault-tls-issuer`). The policy depends on `policy-cert-manager-operator-install`.
  The `autoshift-ca` issuer is provisioned per-cluster by **`policy-cert-manager-ca`** (each cluster its
  own CA; keys never leave the cluster). For **two-tier transit**, the spoke can't use its own CA to trust
  the hub, so the transit sync distributes the hub CA's **public** cert (`vault-transit-ca`) to spokes and
  the transit seal validates the hub Vault Route cert against it.

## Seal backend (auto-unseal) — `autoshift.io/vault-seal-type`

The seal backend is a **per-cluster label**, so the same chart serves every environment and both
topologies. Init is automated by a Job (`policy-vault-init`) on auto-unseal clusters; with an
auto-unseal seal, `vault operator init` also unseals — **no unseal keys are ever stored, no cron**.
Init produces only break-glass *recovery* keys (stashed in `secret/vault-init` for operators to retrieve,
secure, and delete).

| `vault-seal-type` | Topology | Unseal | Hub blast radius |
|---|---|---|---|
| `shamir` (default) | independent | **manual ceremony** (below) | none |
| `awskms` / `gcpckms` / `azurekeyvault` | independent | auto (cloud KMS + workload identity) | none |
| `transit` | two-tier | auto (via the hub Vault) | yes (opt-in) |

**Independent vs two-tier is a blast-radius choice.** Cloud-KMS and Shamir clusters have their own root
of trust and no hub dependency. `transit` clusters auto-unseal against a central hub Vault — convenient
and centrally recoverable, but a compromised/unavailable hub affects them. Pick per cluster.

### Two-tier (`transit`)
- Mark the hub Vault `autoshift.io/vault-transit-provider: 'true'` and set
  `autoshift.io/vault-external-hostname` to its external Route hostname. `policy-vault-transit-provider`
  configures the transit engine + `autoshift-unseal` key + a scoped token + a recovery KV; the chart
  exposes a **passthrough Route** at that hostname and adds it to the Vault TLS cert's SANs.
- **Spokes just set `vault-seal-type: 'transit'`** — the unseal address is **auto-discovered**: the seal
  config's `{{hub}}` template resolves on the hub and `lookup`s the hub Vault Route host there, so spokes
  need no address config and never drift from the hub's actual Route. (`vault-transit-address` remains an
  optional override for an external LB / custom DNS / a non-local hub.) The in-cluster Service is never
  used — it's unreachable cross-cluster. `policy-vault-transit-token` copies the provider's token onto
  each spoke, along with the hub CA's **public** cert (`vault-transit-ca`). The Route is passthrough, so the
  spoke's transit seal validates the hub Vault cert against the distributed hub CA (hence the Route hostname
  must be in the hub cert SANs, handled above). CAs are per-cluster — only the hub's public cert crosses.
- Recovery keys for spokes are stored in the hub Vault's recovery KV — self-contained, no cloud dependency.

### Cloud KMS (`awskms` / `gcpckms` / `azurekeyvault`)
Set `vault-seal-type` + the `vault-seal-kms-*` labels (region, key id, project/key-ring, tenant/vault
name). Grant the KMS via **workload identity** (IRSA / GKE WI / Azure WI) on the Vault ServiceAccount —
no stored credentials. Fully independent auto-unseal.

### Shamir (default) — one-time manual ceremony
Shamir's unseal keys **are** the root of trust; storing them anywhere automated defeats the seal, so this
tier keeps a manual bootstrap (and manual unseal after each restart). Use it for air-gap or when a cluster
must not depend on a hub or cloud KMS. After the pods are Running (they stay `NotReady` until unsealed):

```sh
oc exec -n vault vault-0 -- vault operator init          # SAVE the unseal keys + root token securely
oc exec -n vault vault-0 -- vault operator unseal <key>  # x3 (threshold), on each pod
```

A **Shamir hub** that is *also* the transit provider: do the ceremony above, then put its root/admin token
in `secret/vault-bootstrap-token` (key `token`) so `policy-vault-transit-provider` can configure transit.

## Disconnected / air-gap

- **Seal choice**: use **`transit`** (two-tier — fleet-internal, no internet) or **`shamir`**. Cloud KMS
  (`awskms`/`gcpckms`/`azurekeyvault`) needs the cloud KMS API and does **not** work air-gapped. The
  `autoshift-ca` issuer is self-signed, so TLS trust needs no external CA.
- **Images** — mirror the tag-referenced chart images:
  - `docker.io/hashicorp/vault:1.17.2` (server + injector agent), `docker.io/hashicorp/vault-k8s:1.4.2`
    (injector). They are in `scripts/known-additional-images.json` (key `vault`), so
    `scripts/generate-imageset-config.sh` adds them to the imageset when `vault: 'true'`; `oc mirror`
    copies them to the mirror registry.
  - Add a **tag** redirect to your disconnected config `mirrorRegistry.tagMirrors`
    (`source: docker.io/hashicorp`) — tag-referenced images need an ImageTagMirrorSet, not IDMS.
  - Set `autoshift.io/vault-job-image` to a mirrored CLI image on baremetal/clusters without the internal
    image registry (the init/transit-provider Jobs default to the internal `openshift/cli`).
- **Deploy mode**: use **OCI mode**. The upstream Vault chart is rendered to plain manifests at release
  time (baked into the OCI artifact), so nothing pulls `helm.releases.hashicorp.com` on the cluster. Git
  mode (on-cluster CMP render) would pull the chart at deploy time and needs the chart vendored/mirrored.

## Versions & updating

Two **decoupled** version knobs:

| Knob | Where | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| **Helm chart** version | `manifests/vault/kustomization.yaml` `helmCharts[].version` | repo-level (build-time pull; **not** a per-cluster label) — controls the deployment scaffolding |
| **Vault server** image tag | `autoshift.io/vault-version` label (default in the chart's `server.image.tag` lookup) | per-cluster override; controls the running Vault binary |

The injector image (`vault-k8s`) has no explicit tag, so it follows the **chart** default.

### Bump the Vault server version
Set `autoshift.io/vault-version` on the clusterset/cluster (or change its default in the chart lookup +
`_example.yaml`). No chart change needed. Also update the mirror tag (below) for disconnected.

### Bump the Helm chart version (manual — no auto-bumper)
1. Edit `manifests/vault/kustomization.yaml` → `helmCharts[].version`.
2. Read the new chart's default image tags:
   `helm show values hashicorp/vault --version <new> | grep -B1 -A2 -E 'image:|tag:'`
3. **Keep these in sync with the new image tags** (drift here breaks disconnected mirroring):
   - `scripts/known-additional-images.json` (`vault` key) — server + `vault-k8s` tags. **Required** so
     `oc mirror` copies the right images.
   - `autoshift.io/vault-version` default (chart lookup + `_example.yaml`) — if the default server should track the chart.
   - `README.md` + `_example.yaml` mirror comment (docs).
4. Re-render to confirm the pull:
   `KUSTOMIZE_PLUGIN_HOME=.tools/kustomize-plugin POLICY_GEN_ENABLE_HELM=true .tools/kustomize build --enable-alpha-plugins --enable-helm --load-restrictor LoadRestrictionsNone manifests/vault`
   (repulls into the gitignored `charts/vault-<new>/`; the old cache is stale, safe to delete).
5. `cd tools && go test -tags integration ./internal/resolver/...`, then re-release (OCI).
