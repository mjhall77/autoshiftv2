# Hub-of-hubs topology

This document explains how AutoShift works in a **hub-of-hubs** (a.k.a. *global hub*)
topology: one top-level hub that manages other hubs, each of which in turn manages its own
spoke clusters.

If you only run a single hub you do not need any of this — see
[quickstart.md](quickstart.md). This document is for the multitiered case, which trips
people up because of one non-obvious Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes rule that reshapes everything.

---

## The rule everything follows from

> **A cluster can be managed by exactly one Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management instance.**

A managed cluster runs a single agent (klusterlet) registered to a single hub. That means a
spoke hub like `hub1`, which is imported into the **hub-of-hubs** Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management, **cannot also
manage itself**. `hub1` has *no* `local-cluster` entry in its own Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management instance. Its own Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management instance manages
only *its* spokes (`spoke1`, `spoke2`) — never `hub1` itself.

Two consequences flow from this, and they are the whole reason the architecture looks the
way it does:

1. **Anything that must land *on* `hub1` — operators, configuration, upgrades, and even the
   policies that label or provision clusters from `hub1` — has to be deployed by the
   *hub-of-hubs* AutoShift.** Only the hub-of-hubs' Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management manages `hub1`, so only the hub-of-hubs can place
   a policy onto it. `hub1`'s own AutoShift physically cannot target `hub1`.
2. **`hub1`'s own AutoShift is limited to two things:** (a) configuring `hub1`'s *spokes*
   (policies that `hub1`'s Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management distributes down to `spoke1`/`spoke2`), and (b) producing
   `hub1`-local **config resources**: the `cluster-set.*` / `managed-cluster.*` /
   rendered-config ConfigMaps — which ArgoCD applies directly to `hub1` (no Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management required).

Therefore the top hub manages itself and the hubs below it; every lower hub is managed *from above*
and only reaches *downward* to its own spokes.

## Management topology

[![AutoShift hub-of-hubs schematic](diagrams/autoshift-hub-of-hubs.drawio.svg)](diagrams/autoshift-hub-of-hubs.drawio.svg)

- The hub-of-hubs Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management manages **itself** (top hub — it is self-managed) plus **hub1** and **hub2**.
- hub1's Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management manages **spoke1/spoke2** but **not hub1** (hub1 is managed from above).
- hub2's Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management manages **spoke3** but **not hub2**.
- The hub-of-hubs **cannot see** spoke1/spoke2/spoke3 at all — those are two boundaries away.

```
hub-of-hubs   ── manages ──►  itself, hub1, hub2
hub1          ── manages ──►  spoke1, spoke2        (HoH cannot see these)
hub2          ── manages ──►  spoke3                (HoH cannot see this)
```

## Who can place a policy where

This is the crux. An AutoShift instance can only place a Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management policy onto a cluster that
*its* Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management manages. Map that onto the topology and you get a strict division of labor:

| Target cluster | Managed by | Policies on it are deployed by | hub1's own AutoShift can target it? |
|---|---|---|---|
| hub-of-hubs (self) | hub-of-hubs Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management | hub-of-hubs AutoShift | n/a |
| **hub1** (the hub itself) | **hub-of-hubs Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management** | **hub-of-hubs AutoShift** | ❌ **no**: hub1's Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management does not manage hub1 |
| spoke1 / spoke2 | hub1 Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management | hub1 AutoShift | ✅ yes (these are hub1's managed clusters) |

What each AutoShift instance is responsible for:

- **hub-of-hubs AutoShift** (`policies-autoshift`):
  - Configures the hub-of-hubs itself.
  - Configures **hub1/hub2 themselves**: their operators, Day 2 config, upgrades. The
    feature labels in `hub1.yaml` (e.g. `odf`, `acs`) are consumed *here*, because the hub-of-hubs
    is what places those operator policies onto hub1.
  - Deploys the **cluster-labels** and **cluster-install** policies that need to *execute on*
    hub1 (placed there through the `managedHub` target — see the following section).
- **hub1 AutoShift** (`policies-hub1`):
  - Configures hub1's **spokes**: operator/config policies that hub1's Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management distributes down
    to spoke1/spoke2.
  - Produces hub1-local **config ConfigMaps** (through ArgoCD sync) describing hub1's clusterset
    and its spokes. These are what the hub-of-hubs-deployed policies read at runtime.
  - **Does not, and cannot, configure hub1 itself.**

---

## `cluster-labels` targets across the tiers

The `cluster-labels` policy (`policies/stable/cluster-labels/templates/policy-cluster-labels.yaml`)
reads each hub clusterset's `self-managed` label and generates two kinds of targets:

| `self-managed` | Target generated | Placement | Where it runs |
|---|---|---|---|
| `'true'`  | `selfManagedHub` | the instance's own `local-cluster` | on the hub running this AutoShift |
| `'false'` | `managedHub`     | the spoke hubs in this instance's values | distributed down onto those spoke hubs |

In the hub-of-hubs instance, `hubofhubs` is `self-managed: 'true'` and `hub1`/`hub2` are
`self-managed: 'false'`, so the hub-of-hubs generates **both** targets:

```mermaid
graph TD
    HoHAS["HoH AutoShift (policies-autoshift)"]
    HoHAS --> SMH["selfManagedHub policy<br/>placed on HoH local-cluster"]
    HoHAS --> MH["managedHub policy<br/>placed on hub1 / hub2"]

    SMH --> SMHrun["runs on HoH · loops every cluster HoH sees<br/>→ stamps HoH-self, hub1, hub2<br/>owning-namespace = policies-autoshift"]
    MH --> MHrun["runs on hub1 · loops every cluster hub1 sees<br/>→ stamps spoke1, spoke2<br/>owning-namespace = policies-hub1"]

    classDef box fill:#1D4174,stroke:#1D4174,color:#ffffff;
    class HoHAS,SMH,MH,SMHrun,MHrun box;
```

- The **`selfManagedHub`** policy runs on the hub-of-hubs and labels everything the hub-of-hubs' Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management sees —
  including **hub1** and **hub2** (they get `owning-namespace: policies-autoshift`).
- The **`managedHub`** policy is **deployed by the hub-of-hubs but executes on hub1** (hub-of-hubs' Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management
  distributes it there). Running on hub1, it sees hub1's managed clusters (spoke1/spoke2) and
  labels them. It reads the per-spoke config from **hub1's own** ConfigMaps.

> Leaf spokes are never a separate placement target — they get labeled simply because they
> are visible to whichever hub the policy is executing on.

---

## Why the lookups are not namespace-bound

This falls straight out of the preceding rule and is the single most important implementation
detail to understand.

The `managedHub` cluster-labels policy and the cluster-install policies **execute on hub1**
but are **authored and deployed by the hub-of-hubs AutoShift**. To do their job they must read the
config that **hub1's own AutoShift** produced (which spokes exist, their site config, their
labels). But the hub-of-hubs-authored policy has **no idea which namespace** hub1's AutoShift uses —
that is a decision made by a *different* AutoShift instance on a *different* cluster.

Therefore the policies never hard-code a namespace. They do a **cluster-wide lookup filtered by a
well-known label**:

```go
// not: lookup "v1" "ConfigMap" "policies-hub1" "..."   ← HoH can't know "policies-hub1"
lookup "v1" "ConfigMap" "" "" "autoshift.io/cluster-labels"      // cluster-labels reads these
lookup "v1" "ConfigMap" "" "" "autoshift.io/rendered-config-map" // cluster-install reads these
```

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant HoH as HoH AutoShift<br/>(policies-autoshift)
    participant H1ACM as HoH ACM
    participant CPC as hub1 config-policy-controller
    participant CM as hub1 ConfigMaps<br/>(policies-hub1)
    participant SP as spoke1 / spoke2

    Note over HoH: hub1 AutoShift (separately) syncs<br/>cluster-set.* / managed-cluster.* into policies-hub1
    HoH->>H1ACM: define managedHub / cluster-install policy
    H1ACM->>CPC: distribute policy onto hub1 (HoH manages hub1)
    CPC->>CM: lookup ConfigMap "" "" by autoshift.io/* label
    Note right of CPC: cluster-wide — doesn't know the namespace
    CM-->>CPC: hub1's clusterset + spoke config
    CPC->>SP: stamp labels / provision spokes
```

The flow:

1. **hub1's own AutoShift** syncs the config ConfigMaps (`cluster-set.*`,
   `managed-cluster.*`, rendered-config) into `policies-hub1` through ArgoCD — plain ConfigMaps,
   no Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management involved, so this works even though hub1's Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management does not manage hub1.
2. **The hub-of-hubs' AutoShift** defines the cluster-labels/cluster-install policy and, because the
   hub-of-hubs' Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management manages hub1, distributes it onto hub1.
3. **On hub1**, the policy does a cluster-wide, label-selected lookup to find those
   ConfigMaps wherever they happen to live, reads the config, and acts on hub1's managed
   clusters (labeling spoke1/spoke2, provisioning new clusters, etc.).

If those lookups were namespace-bound, the hub-of-hubs-deployed policy would have to know the spoke
hub's AutoShift namespace ahead of time — which it cannot. The label-selected, cluster-wide
lookup is what lets a policy authored on one hub consume config produced by an independent
AutoShift instance on another.

## Standing up each tier (deployment)

tier-1 (hub-of-hubs) and tier 2 (hub1) are **two separate AutoShift bootstraps**. The second is not
a side effect of the first.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Admin
    participant HoH as Hub-of-Hubs AutoShift
    participant H1 as hub1 cluster
    participant H1AS as hub1 AutoShift

    Note over Admin,HoH: tier-1 — stand up the global hub
    Admin->>HoH: Bootstrap GitOps + ACM, create app "autoshift"
    Note right of HoH: values: global.yaml + hubofhubs.yaml + hub1.yaml

    Note over HoH,H1: HoH prepares AND configures hub1 (it manages it)
    HoH->>H1: provision/import hub1, install GitOps + ACM on it
    HoH->>H1: place hub1's operator/day-2/upgrade policies on it

    Note over Admin,H1AS: Tier 2 — a SEPARATE bootstrap on hub1
    Admin->>H1AS: create app "hub1" targeting the hub1 cluster
    Note right of H1AS: values: global.yaml + hub1.yaml + managed.yaml + spoke values
    H1AS->>H1: sync hub1-local config ConfigMaps (via ArgoCD)
    H1AS->>H1: deploy policies for hub1's SPOKES only
```

1. **Bootstrap the hub-of-hubs** like any single hub (GitOps + Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management), then create its AutoShift
   Application (`autoshift`). Its policies live in `policies-autoshift`.
2. The hub-of-hubs' values include its own clusterset (`hubofhubs.yaml`, `self-managed: 'true'`)
   **and** an entry per spoke hub (`hub1.yaml`, `self-managed: 'false'`). The hub-of-hubs uses the
   latter to manage and configure hub1.
3. The hub-of-hubs provisions/imports hub1 and installs **GitOps + Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management** on it, then places hub1's
   own operator/config/upgrade policies onto it.
4. **Bootstrap AutoShift on hub1**, either way round:
   - *Push*: create a *second* Application on the hub-of-hubs (`hub1`) whose destination is the
     hub1 cluster, policies in `policies-hub1`. A deliberate step: re-run the bootstrap, or commit
     a second Application in GitOps.
   - *Per-hub*: label hub1 with `autoshift.io/autoshift-enable-install: 'true'` and describe the
     deployment in `config.managedAutoshift`. The `managed-autoshift` policy then runs **on hub1**
     and creates the Application in hub1's **own** Argo CD, pointing at hub1 itself. Nothing is
     created on the hub-of-hubs. See
     [policies/stable/managed-autoshift](../policies/stable/managed-autoshift/README.md).

   Use one or the other. Both would give hub1 two AutoShift instances.
5. hub1's AutoShift syncs its config ConfigMaps and deploys policies for **its spokes**.
6. The hub-of-hubs-deployed cluster-labels/cluster-install policies (executing on hub1) read those
   ConfigMaps and manage hub1's spokes.

---

## Naming and namespaces per tier

Each AutoShift instance is identified by its ArgoCD Application name (`Release.Name`); its
policy namespace is `policies-{Release.Name}`.

| Tier | App (`Release.Name`) | Policy namespace | Destination | Typical `valueFiles` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Hub-of-Hubs | `autoshift` | `policies-autoshift` | the hub-of-hubs (local-cluster) | `global.yaml`, `hubofhubs.yaml`, `hub1.yaml`, `hub2.yaml` |
| Spoke hub 1 | `hub1` | `policies-hub1` | hub1 | `global.yaml`, `hub1.yaml`, `managed.yaml`, `clusters/spoke1.yaml` |
| Spoke hub 2 | `hub2` | `policies-hub2` | hub2 | `global.yaml`, `hub2.yaml`, `managed.yaml`, `clusters/spoke3.yaml` |

> Keep `policies-{Release.Name}` ≤ 20 characters (so `Release.Name` ≤ 11): the namespace
> prefixes object names generated by Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management, which that have a 62-character ceiling.

`hub1.yaml` appears in two instances with two meanings — and this is what makes the
relationship feel complicated:

- On the **hub-of-hubs**, the `hub1` clusterset is `self-managed: 'false'`: "a spoke hub I manage and
  configure." Its operator labels drive what the hub-of-hubs installs *onto* hub1.
- On **hub1's own instance**, hub1 is the cluster it runs on, but its Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management does not manage it —
  so hub1's instance cannot act on hub1. Its useful work is the spoke config and the local
  ConfigMaps the hub-of-hubs-deployed policies consume.

---

## Labeling and ownership across tiers

`owning-namespace` / `owning-deployment` are auto-stamped by cluster-labels and identify
which AutoShift instance owns a cluster:

- The hub-of-hubs' `selfManagedHub` policy stamps **hub1** with
  `autoshift.io/owning-namespace: policies-autoshift` (the hub-of-hubs owns hub1).
- The hub-of-hubs' `managedHub` policy, running on hub1, stamps **spoke1/spoke2** with
  `autoshift.io/owning-namespace: policies-hub1` (read from hub1's own ConfigMaps).
- These are different namespaces on different clusters; there is no conflict, because each
  instance only owns clusters its own Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management instance sees.

`cluster-install` uses `owning-namespace` (matched against the namespace of the
rendered-config ConfigMap it found through the cross-namespace lookup) to decide whether it
should manage a given cluster — the basis for migrating a cluster between instances.

---

## Worked example: following one config change

Set `acs: 'true'` for **spoke1**:

1. Put it in spoke1's values (`clusters/spoke1.yaml` or the `managed` clusterset) loaded by
   the **hub1** AutoShift app — *not* the hub-of-hubs app. The hub-of-hubs has never heard of spoke1.
2. hub1's AutoShift syncs a `managed-cluster.spoke1` ConfigMap into `policies-hub1`.
3. The hub-of-hubs-deployed `managedHub` cluster-labels policy, executing on hub1, reads that
   ConfigMap (cross-namespace lookup) and stamps `autoshift.io/acs: 'true'` onto spoke1.
4. hub1's Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes (ACS) policy (deployed by hub1's AutoShift, since hub1's Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management manages spoke1) matches
   the label and installs ACS on spoke1.

With this update set `acs: 'true'` for **hub1**:

1. Put it in the `hub1` clusterset in the **hub-of-hubs'** values — because the hub-of-hubs is what manages
   and configures hub1. Putting it in hub1's own instance would do nothing, since hub1's Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management
   cannot place a policy on hub1.

---

## Common pitfalls

- **Expecting hub1's own AutoShift to configure hub1.** It cannot — hub1's Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management does not manage
  hub1. Configure hub1 from the hub-of-hubs (the `hub1` clusterset in the hub-of-hubs' values).
- **Expecting the hub-of-hubs to configure leaf spokes.** It cannot see them. Configure them on the
  spoke hub's AutoShift instance.
- **Forgetting to bootstrap AutoShift on the spoke hub.** Installing Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management on hub1 through the hub-of-hubs
  does not give hub1 an AutoShift instance — that is a separate bootstrap.
- **Assuming lookups are namespace-scoped.** they are cluster-wide and label-selected on
  purpose, so a hub-of-hubs-deployed policy can find a spoke hub's config without knowing its
  namespace. do not "fix" them to a fixed namespace.
- **Reusing a `Release.Name`/namespace across instances on one cluster.** Keep them distinct
  and ≤ 20 chars (`policies-{Release.Name}`).
